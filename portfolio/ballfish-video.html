    	<p>This is dummy copy. It is not meant to be read. It has been 
placed here solely to demonstrate the look and feel of finished, typeset
 text. Only for show. He who searches for meaning here will be sorely 
disappointed.  These words are here to provide the reader with a basic 
impression of how actual text will appear in its final presentation. </p>
   	<p>This is dummy copy. It's Greek to you. Unless, of course, you're 
Greek, in which case, it really makes no sense. Why, you can't even read
 it!  It is strictly for mock-ups. You may mock it up as strictly as you
 wish.</p>
